# Dental Practice Webpage
Static webpage prototype for my mothers dental practice (using astro.js)  
Only the Mobile View was worked on. (Open web console switch to mobile viewport)

## Project Context
When my mother opened her own dental practice in 2023, I was currently experimenting with astro.js. Given the opportunity I started working on her webpage for fun and to try out Astro in a real project (even if small). The webpage remains a prototype and has not been published.
